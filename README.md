# MusicCast Control

A simple Windows GUI to control your MusicCast amplifier's power, input device and volume.

Usage: Put your amplifier's IP address on the second line of settings.ini. 192.168.0.10 used by default.


In the future the plan is to include the possibility to add/remove inputs from settings file and to add controls for at least lows, mids and highs.
